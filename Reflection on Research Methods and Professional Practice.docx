Introduction
In this reflection, I will critically examine my learning journey throughout the Research Methods and Professional Practice module, undertaken in April 2024. This reflection will address the critical incidents that shaped my understanding of research methods, statistical analysis, and professional skills development. It will also evaluate my performance in completing module tasks, including the required statistics exercises, and reflect on how this module has contributed to my growth as both a researcher and professional. Finally, I will outline how this learning experience will inform my future work in the computing field.
WHAT: Project Outcomes and Learning
Throughout the module, I engaged in a variety of activities designed to enhance my understanding of research methods, ethics, and statistical analysis. The following areas were key learning outcomes:
•	Research Ethics: The introduction to research methods in Unit 1 provided valuable insights into the ethical considerations of research in computing. I learned about the importance of data privacy, informed consent, and the need to avoid bias in research designs (Babbie, 2020). Understanding these principles is crucial, as ethical research practices ensure the integrity and credibility of findings.
•	Literature Review and Research Proposal: Units 2 and 3 focused on the principles of academic investigation, literature review processes, and research design. I learned to critically evaluate existing literature to identify gaps, leading to the formulation of a focused research question. This exercise significantly impacted my ability to develop a sound research proposal (Creswell, 2018).
•	Statistical Analysis: Units 6 and 7 introduced descriptive and inferential statistics. Completing several exercises that required applying these statistical methods to analyze research data strengthened my capacity to use statistics to support research findings (Field, 2017). This practical experience helped demystify complex statistical concepts, making them more accessible for real-world applications.
•	Professional Skills Development: One of the most significant outcomes was completing a professional skills matrix and conducting a SWOT analysis to identify my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. This exercise allowed me to set specific goals for personal and professional growth (Kolb, 1984).
SO WHAT: Analyzing the Learning Experience
Reflecting on the tasks I completed throughout this module, it is evident that I gained a deeper understanding of the role of research in the computing field and its impact on professional practice.
•	Critical Evaluation of Literature: Before this module, I underestimated the complexity of conducting a thorough literature review. Through various exercises, I learned to synthesize existing research and apply it to my chosen topic, refining my research question to address a real-world issue (Creswell, 2018). The ability to critically evaluate literature is invaluable in ensuring that my research contributes meaningfully to the field.
•	Research Methodology Challenges: One of the challenges I faced was designing a valid research methodology that could be generalized to a wider audience. The exercises on validity and generalizability (Unit 9) were particularly useful in helping me address this issue (Saunders M. L., 2019). By recognizing the importance of sound methodology, I now feel more equipped to tackle similar challenges in future research endeavors.
•	Statistics Exercises: Working through the statistical exercises, particularly those focused on inferential statistics and hypothesis testing in Units 7 and 8, was eye-opening. Initially, I struggled to apply statistical formulas to real-life data, but the worksheets and practical applications helped me improve my analytical skills (Field, 2017). This newfound proficiency in statistics has enhanced my overall research capabilities.
•	Action Plan and Professional Growth: The professional skills matrix and SWOT analysis provided a structured approach to assessing my professional development. Identifying my strengths, such as problem-solving and analytical skills, alongside weaknesses like time management, allowed me to prioritize areas for improvement (Rolfe, 2001). This process of self-assessment has empowered me to take actionable steps toward my career goals.
NOW WHAT: Applying the Learning to Future Work
The skills and knowledge I acquired from this module will profoundly shape my future endeavors.
•	Research and Analysis: The ability to critically appraise existing research and produce sound research proposals will be invaluable as I continue to engage in computing projects. I now have the confidence to apply robust research methodologies and statistical analysis to validate findings (Creswell, 2018). This competency will enhance my contributions to my team and organization.
•	Professional Application: The insights gained into the ethical, social, and legal implications of research in computing will guide my professional practice. I am now more aware of the importance of data protection and ethical considerations when working on computing projects, especially those involving sensitive information (Babbie, 2020). Adhering to ethical guidelines will bolster my professional reputation and the credibility of my work.
•	Action Plan for Continuous Improvement: Moving forward, I plan to utilize my SWOT analysis and professional skills matrix to continue my development. One immediate step is enrolling in a time management course to address one of my key weaknesses. Additionally, I will seek opportunities to apply the statistical skills I developed, perhaps by working on data analysis projects in my professional role.
•	Long-Term Goals: My long-term aspiration is to become a more effective researcher and professional in the field of computing, particularly focusing on cybersecurity. The knowledge gained in this module about research methods, data analysis, and ethics will serve as a strong foundation for achieving this goal. I aim to stay abreast of industry developments and continuously refine my skills to meet the evolving demands of the field.
Conclusion
In summary, the Research Methods and Professional Practice module has been instrumental in shaping my understanding of research in the computing field. From ethical considerations to statistical analysis, each aspect of the module has contributed to my overall growth as a professional. The reflection process has allowed me to critically analyze my experiences and set clear goals for future improvement, ensuring that I continue developing as a researcher and computing professional. As I apply the skills and knowledge gained from this module, I am optimistic about my ability to contribute to the computing field and pursue a successful career in research and professional practice.
